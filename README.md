Section A: Title: Regression model
Problem:
Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. From the United States
to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all types of cuisines here. Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs,
Bars, Drinks, Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru is the best place
for foodies. The number of restaurants is increasing day by day. Currently, it stands at
approximately 12,000 restaurants. With such a high number of restaurants. This industry
hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However, it has
become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues
that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs,
shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain, and over-licensing.
Objective:
The newly started companies are not able to decide the cost that would happen per
two people for once. So the Zomato company has a good analyst team who can predict the
cost per two customers for one time so that the newly started restaurants and upcoming
restaurants will be well prepared how the restaurant should invest in improving the
ambiance and all other stuff to attract the customers. Assume you are the analyst team that
Zomato has organized to help new and upcoming restaurants by letting them know the
various reasons that customers look for and build a model which able to predict the cost for
two people.
Steps that are to be followed:
Step 1: Understand the business problem.
Step 2: Read the data, and convert the data types.
Note: The data set has numerical and categorical data but due to noise(anomaly) in
the data, the columns are treated as the object type. And You may feel like converting the
features into numerical at this step if not appropriate at this stage, In that case, feel free to
convert the variable to the appropriate type in the further step as well based on your way
of analyzing the data.



Step 3: Perform the described method for the data, Try to find any essential points from the
described analysis. And check the missing values and Duplicate records. Impute the
missing values in the best way possible.
Note: To impute the missing values with parameters, You must find the best parameter.
Hints:
‚óè Check the distribution using plots. And check the Skewness, Kurtosis and etc.
Step 4: Once the basic preprocessing is done like converting the data types, missing value
imputation, and duplicate rows. perform the EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on the data to
find the various factors that will help to understand the cost per two persons.
Step 5: Make a copy of the data set and Perform the preprocessing that require for the
model.
Note: You can see many categorical variables with a high number of unique values.
Therefore do not keep dropping the variables as the first option, try to create new variables
or perform any other feature engineering methods.
Step 6: Perform statistical hypothesis testing on features to get an idea of whether features
are impacting the target variables.
Step 7: Split the dataset into train and test data sets and Perform the scaling on both sets if
necessary.
Step 8: Build the base model.
Step 9: Understand how the model is performing, Perform feature engineering again if
needed. Do feature selection. Try with various models like a parametric and
nonparametric models. Once you choose the final model, rebuild the model with best
parameters.
Note: If you are performing with Linear models, check the model is fulfilling the
assumptions.
Step 10: Based on your understanding of the model and EDA analysis, Explain the business
understanding.


Problem Statement:
The model that you built in the above case study has gone to deployment and Zomato has
been impressed with your data analysis and Zomoto has been believing that your analysis
going to be impactful. Now Zomato has been observing the orders happening online and
offline, Due to offline orders, Zomato is not able to attract customers with diverse items and
offers, and the user subscription also getting low. so it has decided to give you the project
on the same. Now the problem statement is that Zomato wants to know whether the
customer would order the orders online or offline so that Zomato can take further
strategies to improve the online order.
Objective:
The Aim is to classify the orders that have been ordered online and offline. And
identify the patterns that lead to orders online orders as well as offline. Your model should
be able to classify the classes effectively.
Steps that are to be followed:
Step 1: Understand the problem statement, Identify the metric for the problem.
Step 2: Use the data sets that have been cleaned data types and missing values in section A
step 3.
Step 3:
i) Explore the data and find the hidden patterns in the data that affect your
objective(target variable).
ii) Find the features that would impact the target variable.
Step 4: Do the preprocessing in a way that impacts the models that you going to build.
Note: If you feel the few preprocessing steps that you did in section 1, feel free to use
those steps.
Step 5: Prove statistically about step 2 point ii.
Step 6: Split the data into train and test sets.
Step 7: Build the base model and Identify your metric based on the problem.
Step 8: Try to improve your metric by trying different models, changing the feature
engineering methods, feature selection, etc.
Step 8: Choose the final model and tune the model.
Step 9: Write your business interpretation. And explain the reasons behind choosing the
final model and how the chosen model performs well compared to other models.
